# MarchingIslands

Collection of various algorithms for Unreal Engine.
Marching Cubes, Simplex Noise, Icosphere Subdivision

Class to generate spherical terrain which is mapped to a square grid so as to make use of the Marching Cubes algorithm and allow for fully volumetric terrain to be generated on a spherical surface. Use of Marching Cubes allows for this surface to be modified and rendered in realtime, although tools for the user to do so will most likely not be made available in this repo as I'll probably blueprint them.

More thoughtout information about this project can be found at http://patrickchadbourne.com/project-icoterrain

Repo is currently in need of a refactoring pass which will be done once my schedule has more room for my personal projects. This is unfortunately not expected until ~Q4 2017
